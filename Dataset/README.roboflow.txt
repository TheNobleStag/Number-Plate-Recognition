The dataset includes 579 images.
Number-plates are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically
